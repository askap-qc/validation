# ASKAP-FLASH data validation script

11 Nov 2020, written by Hyein Yoon

- Please visit the link to see the validation output reports from individual SBIDs: https://github.com/hyeinyoon/askapflash-validation

- At this stage, this validation script just focuses on a successful/efficient run.

- As there are missing askapsoft outputs to run the script completely now, some dummy data/plots are used.

- Hence, please do not focus too much on the meaning of specific plots and output number.
