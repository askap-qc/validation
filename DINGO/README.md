# DINGO data validation

This folder will contain ASKAP DINGO data validation codes and documents (Related to continuum subtraction residual tests).

DINGO data validation code (DINGO_specline_qa.py) is based on the Wallaby code but modified to work with DINGO data (consisting of two interleaves in one SB).
