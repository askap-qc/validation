- The following files pertaining to the beam in question need to in the directory where 'runfile.sh' is to be run:

image.restored.i.<SB number>.<tile number>.<beam number>.fits
image.restored.i.<SB number>.<tile number>.<beam number>.contsub.fits
selavy-results.txt

- Please replace the <SB number>, <tile number> and <beam number> with the correct values in runfile.sh

- I used Python 2.7, codes might need tweaking for Python 3.

- 'pdfjoin' needs to be installed if you want to generate pdf report containing all plots.
